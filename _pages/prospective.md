#### Am I hiring students?
Yes, I am actively recruiting PhD students to USC in 🍁 Fall 2022! Thanks for your interest ☀️ in my research!
[Applications](https://www.cs.usc.edu/ph-d-application-information/) are open, and the deadline to submit your application is [Dec 15th, 2021](https://days.to/until/15-december).
Please consider <u>selecting [my name](https://www.cs.usc.edu/directory/faculty/profile/?lname=Swayamdipta&fname=Swabha) as a potential advisor</u>, especially if your research interests match [mine](publications/) 🌵


USC waived GRE scores ⚡ for graduate admissions in Fall 2022 and offers [fee waivers](https://gradadm.usc.edu/lightboxes/us-students-fee-waivers/) to select applicants.

&nbsp;

#### Should you send me an email?

You do <em>not</em> have to email me, especially since I haven't officially started at USC and do not have any control over the admissions process. My recommendation to you is to apply through the regular PhD program [admissions](https://www.cs.usc.edu/ph-d-application-information/) by December 15th and USC will be in touch with you regarding the next steps. I plan to go over all applications that list me as a potential advisor. 🌾

&nbsp;

##### What if you are already at USC and want to send me an email?

Please feel free to email me. However, you should know that there is not much I can officially do, just yet. It would be great to meet you and learn about your interests, though! 👋
