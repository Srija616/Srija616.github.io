### Am I recruiting?

I am NO longer recruiting graduate students at USC, or interns at AI2.

<hr>

### Should you send me an email?


#### If you're already at USC:
  * _Masters Students:_
    * _RAships:_ While I'm not able to offer any more RAships at the moment, do consider enrolling for [CSCI-699 Data-Centric NLP](https://swabhs.com/csci699-dcnlp/), a class I will be teaching this Fall. This might lead to potential collaborations in the future. Note that class enrollment is not guaranteed for all Masters students.
    * _TAships:_ I am not looking for Masters Students as TAs at the moment.
  * _PhD Students:_ I no longer have any open TA or RA positions available, but if you think our interests overlap considerably and would like to collaborate, do email me. I might be slow to respond.
  * _Undergrads:_ Please feel free to email me if you are looking for research opportunities. See other opportunities at [CURVE USC](https://viterbiundergrad.usc.edu/research/curve/research-positions/computer-science/).
  <!-- Contact Katie Mills for high school AI research opportunities kmills@usc.edu -->


#### If you're not at USC:
  * _High-school students_: Please consider [K-12 research opportunities at USC](https://www.cs.usc.edu/k-12-outreach/), I do not know my plans to recruit summer students yet.
  * _Others:_ I might not respond if you're looking for recruitment - apologies! Other emails about research questions etc. are welcome, though I might be slow to respond to them.





<!--Yes, I am actively recruiting PhD students to USC in 🍁 Fall 2022! Thanks for your interest ☀️ in my research!
[Applications](https://www.cs.usc.edu/ph-d-application-information/) are open, and the deadline to submit your application is [Dec 15th, 2021](https://days.to/until/15-december).
USC waived GRE scores ⚡ for graduate admissions in Fall 2022 and offers [fee waivers](https://gradadm.usc.edu/lightboxes/us-students-fee-waivers/) to select applicants.


Please consider <u>selecting</u> [my name](https://www.cs.usc.edu/directory/faculty/profile/?lname=Swayamdipta&fname=Swabha) <u>as a potential advisor</u>, especially if your research interests match [mine](/publications/), even though your research background might be different.


I'm broadly interested in:

##### 📚 Estimation of Dataset Quality:
What makes a dataset valuable for training high-capacity models, pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled data? Our [Dataset Cartography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10795) offers point estimates, and [V-Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08420) offers aggregate estimates of dataset quality. Can these estimates be computed without taking into account specific model families?

###### 🎨 Creative Data Curation:
Can we use the lessons above to create high quality datasets, more suitable for modern NLP models? Our work on [Generative Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11546) showed that this is possible to automate to some extent, either via [controlled generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03023) or [selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10964). Is it possible to create collaborative setups between humans and generative models to this end?

##### 🤖 Robustness to Model Biases:

Current large scale models tend to [rely on spurious biases to make the correct predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02324). The reduction of undesirable biases could be done via data selection, as in [AFLite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04108) or by altering the [learning objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03683). However, the discovery of such biases is much trickier and task-dependent.
Going beyond solutions presented in [AFLite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04108), how can we find spurious correlations automatically?

Particularly harmful are social biases in models, such as those which correlate surface markers of certain dialects with subjective attributes such as toxicity. [Social biases cannot be mitigated easily](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00086) and require rethinking data collection and task design, as we show in our [latest paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07997).

##### 🕵🏼‍♀️ Model Interpretability and 👩🏼‍🔬 Meticulous Evaluation:
What cannot be measured, cannot be improved. How can we make our [models explain their decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08674) to human users, [_intuitively_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01378)? Moreover, as tasks previously considered extremely difficult are getting easier, how do we best [adapt our evaluation methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01454) to ensure fair evaluation?-->

## Should you send me an email?

#### If you're NOT at USC:
You do <em>not</em> have to email me, especially since I haven't officially started at USC and do not have any control over the admissions process. My recommendation to you is to apply through the regular PhD program [admissions](https://www.cs.usc.edu/ph-d-application-information/) by December 15th and USC will be in touch with you regarding the next steps. I will go over every single application that lists me as a potential advisor. 🤞

#### If you're already at USC:

Please feel free to email me if you are looking for advising or TA positions. However, you should know that there is not much I can officially do, just yet. It would be great to be introduced and learn about your interests, though! 👋 -->
