<!-- I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/), on the [MOSAIC](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) team led by [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). -->

My research focuses on studying biases in [datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10795) and models.
*Good biases*, such as [structural inductive biases](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1412) help language understanding - check out my [PhD thesis](/assets/pdf/swabha_thesis.pdf) on these.
But biases can be *undesirable*, e.g. [spurious correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04108) commonly found in crowd-sourced, large-scale datasets due to [annotation artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02324), or social prejudices of human annotators and task designers, which are [difficult to rid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00086)!.

##### Previously...
I obtained my [PhD](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/18088/swabha-swayamdipta) from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2019, where I was advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/) and [Chris Dyer](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdyer/).
During most of my PhD I was a visiting student at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) in Seattle.

<!-- Prior to my PhD, I obtained a Masters degree from Columbia University, working with Owen Rambow and Michael Collins.
I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India. -->
