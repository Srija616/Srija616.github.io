I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/), working with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/).
My research interests include interpretability and explainability, and the role of structural inductive biases in language learning.
I am currently part of the [MOSAIC](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) team, where I am exploring dataset artifacts and biases.

I obtained my [PhD](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/18088/swabha-swayamdipta) from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2019, where I was advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/) and [Chris Dyer](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdyer/).
During most of my PhD I was a visiting student at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at University of Washington in Seattle.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a Masters degree from Columbia University, working with Owen Rambow and Michael Collins.
I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India.
