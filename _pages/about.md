I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science in the USC Viterbi School of Engineering](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), where I will be starting the [DILL Lab](https://dill-lab.github.io/).
My research interests broadly span Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
I am primarily interested in the [estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08420) of [dataset quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10795), the [(semi-)automatic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05955) collection of impactful data, as well as [evaluating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01454) how human biases [affect dataset construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07997) and model decisions.
<!-- via the [discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01378) of [undesirable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00086) [biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02324), including [social biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07997). The ultimate goal is advancing generalization not only via [bias reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04108), but also via careful data curation, and [evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01454). -->


I obtained my [PhD](/assets/pdf/swabha_thesis.pdf) from ðŸŒ‰ [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/18088/swabha-swayamdipta), where I was advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/) and [Chris Dyer](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdyer/).
I was a visiting student at ðŸŒ² [UW](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) during most of my PhD, followed by a postdoc at [AI2](https://allenai.org/), working with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/).
I hold a Masters degree from ðŸ—½ [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), and a Bachelors Degree from ðŸ¥¥ [NIT Calicut](https://minerva.nitc.ac.in/).

<!-- Prior to my PhD, I obtained a Masters degree from Columbia University, working with Owen Rambow and Michael Collins.
where I was advised by [Owen Rambow](https://owenrambow.com/)
I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India. -->
