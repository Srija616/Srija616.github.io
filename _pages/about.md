I am a Postdoctoral Young Investigator at Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
My research interests include structured prediction in Natural Language Processing.

I obtained my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2019.
During most of my PhD I was a visiting student at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science at University of Washington in Seattle.
