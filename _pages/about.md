I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/), advised by [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/).
My [research interests](../assets/pdf/Swabha-FacultyJobSearchMaterials-2021/2020_FJM_SS_Research_Statement.pdf) broadly span Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
I am primarily interested in the [estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08420) of [dataset quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10795), via the [discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01378) of [undesirable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00086) [biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02324), including [social biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07997).
The ultimate goal is advancing generalization not only via [bias reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04108), but also via careful data curation, and [evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01454).

During most of my PhD I was a visiting student at the üèîÔ∏è [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/).
I hold a Masters degree from üóΩ [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), and a Bachelors Degree from ü•• [NIT Calicut](https://minerva.nitc.ac.in/).

<!-- Prior to my PhD, I obtained a Masters degree from Columbia University, working with Owen Rambow and Michael Collins.
