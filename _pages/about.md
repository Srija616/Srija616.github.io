I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/), working with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/), as part of the [MOSAIC](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) team.

My research interests include bias in datasets - the good, the bad and the ugly.
There are the *good biases*, such as structural inductive biases beneficial for language understanding, I wrote a [PhD thesis](swabha_thesis.pdf) on these.
On the other hand, crowd-sourced, large-scale datasets are riddled with the *bad biases* arising from [annotation artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02324) which are unintended, [spurious correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04108).
And finally, biases can be *ugly*, when the training data contains a large portion of mislabeled examples, or noise (more on this soon!).


I obtained my [PhD](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/18088/swabha-swayamdipta) from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2019, where I was advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/) and [Chris Dyer](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdyer/).
During most of my PhD I was a visiting student at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a Masters degree from Columbia University, working with Owen Rambow and Michael Collins.
I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India.
