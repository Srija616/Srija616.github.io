<!--
I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/), working with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/), as part of the [MOSAIC](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) team. -->

My research focuses on studying biases in [datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10795) and models - the good, the bad and the ugly.
*Good biases*, such as structural inductive biases are beneficial for language understanding, I wrote a [PhD thesis](/assets/pdf/swabha_thesis.pdf) on these.
*Bad biases* arise from [spurious correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04108) commonly found in crowd-sourced, large-scale datasets due to [annotation artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02324) and have unintended effects.
And finally, biases can be *ugly*, when they stem from social prejudices of human annotators and task designers (coming soon!).


I obtained my [PhD](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/18088/swabha-swayamdipta) from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2019, where I was advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/) and [Chris Dyer](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdyer/).
During most of my PhD I was a visiting student at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle.

<a class="button button1">Update</a> I am looking for <span style="color:#ffcc22">*academic positions*</span> in Winter / Spring 2021!
<!-- Prior to my PhD, I obtained a Masters degree from Columbia University, working with Owen Rambow and Michael Collins.
I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India. -->
